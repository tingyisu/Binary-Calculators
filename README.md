How to run the executable jar files
1. Click on the .jar file
2. Click 'View Raw' (this will download the file onto your computer)
   NOTE: it will give you a warning saying that the file will harm your computer and ask if you want to keep or discard the file. Click            'Keep'
3. Once the file has downloaded onto your computer, simply click on it. Enjoy!
